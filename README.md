Overview
---
This .NET library provides convenient, threadsafe access to MIDI devices. It does this by binding to the Win32 API with P/Invoke and then wrapping that in an object-oriented API which feels right at home in C# / .NET.

Additions to Tom Lokovic's version:
---
This is a further development of the _midi dot net_ library created by Tom Lokovic, with the following mentionable additions:
* **Non-Registered Parameter Number (NRPN) Messages**
  * Ability to both send and receive so-called NRPN messages which enable 14-bit values as well as parameters, greatly increasing both the number of controls you can run on a single channel, but also the resolution (for many precision applications, 128 values might be too coarse).
* **SysEx Messages** (_jstnry_)


Features
---
**MIDI**

* Easy access to MIDI input and output devices.
* Register input handlers using C# events / delegates.
* Full support for sending and receiving Note On, Note Off, Control Change, Program Change, Pitch Bend messages, SysEx and NRPN messages.
* Convenient enums for General MIDI Channels, Pitches, Instruments, Controls, and Percussions.

**Scheduling**

* A powerful scheduler that lets you schedule MIDI messages, pause, unpause, and adjust beats-per-minute while it runs.
* Support for callback messages, so you can schedule call-outs to your own code at specific instants. Callback messages are scheduled just like MIDI messages, so they are subject to pause, unpause, and beats-per-minute as well.
* Callback messages can schedule additional messages when triggered (self-propagating messages), which allows for a flexible continuation-passing style of control.
* Built-in NoteOnOffMessage schedules the Off message when the On message triggers.

**Music Theory**

* Octave-independent Note class which differentiates among enharmonic variants (eg, D♯; and E♭). Notes can be resolved to specific pitches as needed.
* Scale class built from tonic note and ascent pattern. Includes built-in patterns (Major, Melodic Minor Ascending, Chromatic, etc).
* Chord class built from tonic note, ascent pattern, and inversion. Includes built-in chord patterns (Major, Seventh, Diminished, etc).

Documentation
---------
* Interactive demo programs, both console and GUI.
Comprehensive API documentation.
* Unit tests.

Not-Yet-Features
-------
* ~~No support for extended MIDI messages such as System Exclusive ("sysex") messages.~~ [ Added in this repository by Justin Ryan. ]
* No MIDI file I/O.

Requirements
-----
* .NET Framework 3.5.
* Visual Studio C# 2008 (Express or Professional) or later.
* winmm.dll, the Win32 multimedia API which is standard on all modern Windows installs.
